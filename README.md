Datasets: Traffic accident data, weather data, individual data.
Github files: excel sheets (all three unclean and clean datasets), model .ipynb and .py files.

Questions seeking to answer : 

1. Are there seasonal patterns in accident occurrences, and do they correlate with specific weather conditions? Is there any relationship between weather conditions and collisions? 
2. Predict the likelihood of an accident based on time of day, season, and weather conditions.
3. Are certain age groups more likely to be involved in accidents under specific conditions? Identify high-risk age groups. Can we design targeted safety campaigns for high-risk age groups? We can classify the age group into seniors, teenagers, or maybe by generations (Genz, millennials and all) Any relationship between the type of vehicle and the frequency of the accident?
